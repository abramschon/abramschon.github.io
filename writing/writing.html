            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Reinforcement Learning</span> (RL) is a powerful and general field of artificial intelligence that provides a means to learn <span class="highlight">optimal strategies</span>, or policies, to achieve <span class="highlight">specified goals</span>. Although RL models have surpassed both human and other machine-learning models’ performance in a number of domains, the policies that they learn can <span class="highlight">seldom be understood</span> by humans, especially <span class="highlight">non-experts</span>. <span class="highlight">Explainable artificial intelligence</span> (XAI) is a field that focuses on developing AI models that can be <span class="highlight">interpreted</span> by humans. Given AI’s, and specifically RL’s, potential and current use in <span class="highlight">contexts that impact humans</span> (autonomous vehicles, advising policy, etc.), there is a growing need for the <span class="highlight">transparency</span> and <span class="highlight">interpretability</span> of these models. This project explores some of the current literature on interpretability in Reinforcement learning.
